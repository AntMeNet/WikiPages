This screen lets you decide where AntMe! will be installed on your computer. It will automatically suggest a folder, but if you want install it somewhere else, just click on "Change" and then select the folder where you'd rather install it. Then click "Next" to confirm your selection and move on to the next step. In the example shown here, we chose to install the game in Windows' "Program Files" folder.

If you've already installed the other packages (remember, besides AntMe! you need a development environment as well as the .NET and .XNA frameworks) then you can start playing the game now. Just click on the "AntMe" icon. It looks like a red ant.

If all four packages are installed, the AntMe! start screen will appear. From there you can start a new game and create your own little ant colony. We'll talk about how to do that in Lesson 3.
